### 原文
场景假设: 
你和一个朋友聊天，谈到一个乐器。 
你想到你的朋友 Susan 家有 个古钢琴，但是最近被弄坏的故事。于是你说:
这个乐器叫做古钢琴，是 300 多年前由德国制造的。
它看上去像是一个小型的钢琴，在 18 世纪的欧洲非常流行。 [x]
Susan 的祖父在多年以前买了这个乐器。他们家已经拥有这件乐器很久了。[x]
所以，它一定是一件非常贵重的乐器，它被存放在客厅里。
然而，最近它被损坏了。为什么呢?
一个客人用它来弹奏爵士乐，结果，两根琴弦断了。[x]
显然，在一个古钢琴上弹奏爵士乐是件很糟糕的做法。[x]
为什么呢? 因为古钢琴过去主要用作练习乐器，声音不大，并不适合用作大型演出。[x]
那位客人显然不知道这一点，所以她很用力敲击琴键，试图发出很大的声音。[x]
此外，这件久乐器造于几百年前。因此，肯定也是非常容易损坏的。[x]
最后发生了什么?
当 Susan 的爸爸知道这件贵重的乐器损坏了，他震惊了。[x]
那就是为什么现在这件乐器不允许碰了。她父亲的一个朋友正在维修。[x]

### 第三次翻译练习 (2023-09-17/2023-09-19/2023-09-22/2023-09-30)
My friend Susan once told me a story about an old musical instrument in her family.

The musical instrument is called a clavichord , and it was made in Germany over 300 years ago.

It looks like a small piano and was very popular in Europe during the eighteenth century.

Susan’s grandfather bought it many years ago and her family has owned the clavichord for a very long time.

So it must be a valuable instrument. And it is kept in the living room.

However it was damaged recently. why? （How come?）

A visitor was trying to play Jazz on it. As a result, two strings were broken.

Obviously, it is not a good idea to play Jazz on a clavichord.

Why? Because a clavichord was mostly used as a practice instrument, and it was not loud enough for larger performances.

Clearly, the visitor didn't know this so she was trying to make louder sounds by striking the keys very hard.

Apart form that, this old musical instrument was made several hundred years ago, so it must have been very fragile.

what happened in the end ?

Susan's father was shocked, when he learned this precious instrument was damaged.

That is why touching the clavichord is not allowed now.

one of her father's friends is repairing it.
