### 原文
钓鱼是我特别喜爱的一项运动。
我经常一钓数小时却一无所获，但我从不为此烦恼[x]。
有些垂钓者就是不走运，他们往往鱼钓不到，却钓上来些旧靴子和垃圾。我的运气甚至还不及他们。
我什么东西也未钓到过 -- 就连旧靴子也没有[x]。
我总是在河上呆上整整一上午，然后空着袋子回家[x]。
“你可别再钓鱼了!”我的朋友们说，“这是浪费时间。”
然而他们没有认识到重要的一点，我并不是真的对钓鱼有兴趣，我感兴趣的只是独坐孤舟，无所事事![x]

### 翻译
Fishing is my favourite sport. I often fish for hours without catch anything. but this does not worry me. Some fishermen are very unluck. Instead of catch fish, they catch old boots and rubbish. I'm even less luck. I never catch anything - not even old boots. After having spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag. You must give up fishing. My friends say. "It's a wast of time". but they don't realize one important things.
I'm not really interested in fishing. I'm only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all.

Hi, Ladies and gentleman, I think most of you may wonder: how can we live a happier life ?

Today I would like to share with you the story of my friend Danny. 

My friend Danny is a happy man who never worries.

Fishing is his favorite sport.

On Sundays, he often fishes for a long time without catch anything.

but this does not trouble him at all.

Some fishermen may be unfournate. 

Sometimes they fail to catch fish, only to catch old boots and garbage.

But Danny seems to be even more unfortunate than most fishermen. 

He always catches nothing, let alone old boots.

After having spent the whole mornings on the river, he always returns home with empty bag.

Without doubt Donny is one of the worst fishermen in the eyes of his friends.

Even his wife complains about his fruitless efforts.

They all believe that Danny should give up fishing, because he is wasting his time. 

But they don't understand why Danny refuses to follow their seemingly "wise" advice.

Because what really interests Danny is not fishing itself, He is only interested in sitting on the boat and doing nothing at all.

In other words, he actually care nothing about fish. What he cares more about is enjoying the peaceful time on the river without worrying about anything.

I think this is why Danny lives a happier life than most people do.

### 故事转述

有一次在参加了一个 TED 小型演讲会，你和大家分享了你的朋友 Danny 的独特的生活观, 他是一个特别快乐的人，几乎没有烦恼。
今天我想和大家分享我的朋友 Danny 的故事。
我的朋友 Danny 是一个很快乐的人，从不烦恼。
钓鱼是他最喜欢的运动。
在星期天，他常常长时间钓鱼，但是一无所获。
但是这个一点也不让他感到烦恼。
有些垂钓的人可能很不幸运。
有时他们没有钓到鱼，却钓到了旧靴子和垃圾。
但是，Danny 似乎比大多数垂钓者更加不幸。
他总是啥也没有钓到，更别提旧靴子了。
他总是在船上待了整整一上午，然而拿着空空如也的袋子回家。
毫无疑问，在他的朋友眼中，Danny 是最差劲的垂钓者之一。
甚至他的太太也抱怨他徒劳无功。
他们都认为 Danny 应该别再钓鱼了，因为他是在浪费自己的时间。
但是他们不理解为啥 Danny 并不接受他们看似明智的建议。
因为真正让 Danny 感兴趣的并不是钓鱼这件事本身。
他只是喜欢坐在船上无所事事。
换句话说，他其实并不在乎鱼。
他更在乎的是享受在河上的宁静时光，不用去烦恼任何事。
我想，这就是为啥 Danny 比大多数人都活得更加快乐。
