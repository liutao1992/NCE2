### 转述练习
场景想象:
假设你是一个 Greenwood Boys (你也可以换成自己喜欢的乐队名字)的粉丝， 你听说 Greenwood Boys 要来你所在的城市开演唱会，你有几个老外朋友也是 这个乐队的粉丝，你给他们报告这个好消息。

绿林少年组合就要来我们市啦!

目前，他们正在中国各地巡演。

你们一定想知道他们什么时候到达。

我很激动地告诉你们他们明天就到。

他们将乘坐高铁列车来，大部分的粉丝将去火车站迎接他们。[x]

他们的演唱会将会在工人俱乐部举行。[x]

更令人兴奋的是:他们将在这待五天的时间。[x]

在此期间，他们将每天进行一场演出。[x]

所以，你们可以选择五天中任何一天去听他们的演唱会。[x]

我猜有些最疯狂的粉丝这五天中每一天都会去。[x]

我确定演出的俱乐部里到时会人满为患。[x]

因此，警察到时将会非常忙，他们维持秩序的任务将非常重。[x]

每逢这样的场合都是如此。

我去年去过他们的现场演唱会。当时人们成群结队，每个人都很兴奋。[x]

对我来说，那的确是一个非常棒的令人难忘的经历。

所以，这是一个你们不能错过的演唱会。

你们最好赶紧上网买票去吧。
