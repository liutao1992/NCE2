### 原文
我的表弟 Kevin 有一个朋友叫 Tony。这个家伙特别喜欢占别人便宜。
Tony 多年前曾在一家律师事务所上班，现在一家银行工作。
尽管 Tony 的薪水很高，但他常常向朋友借钱。
借钱没什么问题，但是你知道为什么我的表弟很讨厌 Tony?
因为他从来欠朋友的钱都不还。
有一天，Kevin 在一家非常好的餐厅吃晚餐，猜猜他遇见了谁?
对了，他遇到了 Tony。Tony 看见了我的表弟，向他走去，然后和 Kevin 坐在同一张桌 子旁边。[x]
我想 Kevin 心里一定非常担忧，因为 Tony 从来没有向他借过钱。
因此，Kevin 决定先下手为强。
不等 Tony 开口向他借钱，Kevin 提出向 Tony 借 20 英镑。[x]
Kevin 认为，这样相当于告诉 Tony，他没钱。[x]
令人惊讶的是，Tony 立刻就答应了 Kevin 的请求。
然而，Tony 后来要求 Kevin 为他付晚饭钱作为回报。
Tony 肯定是一个小事精明，大事糊涂的人。

My cousin Kevin had a friend called Tony. This guy likes sponging on others. 

Tony used to work for a lawyer’s office several years ago and is now working at a bank.

Even though Tony enrns a handsome salary（gets a good salary）, he frequently borrows money from his friends.


It's ok to borrow money, but do you know why my cousin hates Tony ?

Because he never pays back the money he owes his friends.

One day, Kevin was having dinner at a very nice restaurant and guess who he met ?

Yes , he met Tony. Tony saw my cousin and walked to him and sat at the same table with Kevin.

I think Kevin must have been very anxious, because Tony had never borrowed any money from him.

So Kevin decided to make the frist move.

Instead of waiting for Tony to borrow money from him, Kevin asked Tony to lend him 20 pounds.

In this way, Kevin thought he was telling Tony he didn’t have any money.

Surprisingly, Tony accepted Kevin’s request right away.

However, Tony then asked Kevin to pay for his dinner in return.

Indeed(确实), Tony must be penny wise and pound foolish.
